# pydevelopers - Developers interpreter in Python
A Python interpreter for the Developers programming language

Developers is a joke language that parodies an incident at a Microsoft Developer's conference where Steve Ballmer is supposed to have chanted the word developers at least 14 times in a row. It is basically Brainfuck with a few extensions. It appeared briefly in the Wikipedia in the beginning of 2006, but it has not reappeared anywhere since its deletion.
